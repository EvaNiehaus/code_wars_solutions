In your class, you have started lessons about arithmetic progression. Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will return the first n elements of the sequence with the given common difference d and first element a. Note that the difference may be zero!

The result should be a string of numbers, separated by comma and space.

function arithmeticSequenceElements(a,d,n) {
  let arr = [a];
   for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
    arr.push(arr[i] + d);
  }
   return arr.join(', ');
}
